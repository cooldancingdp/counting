### Steps to Count Money

1. **Separate by Denomination**: Organize your notes and coins by their value.
2. **Count Smaller Denominations First**: Start with the smaller values and move up.
    - Example: Count the ones, then the fives, tens, etc.
3. **Use Your Fingers**: Physically move the notes or coins as you count to keep track.
4. **Double-Check**: Always recount to ensure accuracy.

**Example: Counting £47**

- £20 notes: 2 x £20 = £40
- £5 notes: 1 x £5 = £5
- £1 coins: 2 x £1 = £2

Total: £40 + £5 + £2 = £47
